# How will the beginning of this work???
List of ways this may start:

* You suddenly awaken, in a forest with a headache. You take a look around and find some sticks. what will you do?
* The world is putting its pieces together. It hurts to watch but suddenly youre in the wilderness and dont know where you are. You look around and find some things that might help on your journey. [Items listed in new line]

Options for these could be:

* take sticks
* explore,walk around
* sleep [amt of time here]


# How are the mechanics of the game going to work??
Inventory shouldn't be too big because then it wouldn't properly display. It also shouldn't be too small because then *how are you going to hold something???* I think it should be between 10 to 20 slots of items.

Movement is also something thats a bit off. Theres no way to postition yourself and go in a specific direction. One idea I have to solve that is having the play make a compass to stop *explore*ing and start *move*ing :/. The way this could work is using a move command with a syntax like this:

```
move [direction (north,south,east,west)] [amt of steps/distance????]
```

Another item to address would be world generation. It would be a little boring to be playing in the same place constantly. Using some way of randomizing a mass amount of numbers in a certain amount of time, it may be possible. I dont know a way to do it yet though
